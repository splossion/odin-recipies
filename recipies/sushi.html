        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sushi rice is less of a type of rice than it is a preparation method.
            It's cooked short-grain white rice combined with rice vinegar and other ingredients,
            cooled completely, and then used to make sushi rolls.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups uncooked sushi rice</li>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>½ cup rice vinegar or less to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar or less to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt or less to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4> Cook the Rice</h4>
                <p>Add the rinsed rice to a saucepan with water
                    (use 3 parts water to 2 parts rice).
                    Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and cook, covered,
                    until the rice is tender and all the water has been absorbed. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Cook the Vinegar Mixture</h4>
                <p>Combine the rice vinegar, oil, sugar, and salt in a separate saucepan.
                    Cook over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Season the Rice</h4>
                <p>Allow the vinegar mixture to cool, then stir it into the cooked rice.
                    Stir until the rice is nice and sticky —
                    it'll look wet at first, but it'll dry as it cools. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
